"""Audio capture utilities for Eden.

The :func:`capture_audio` function is implemented so unit tests can run even on
systems without audio hardware or the ``sounddevice`` dependency installed.  If
``sounddevice`` is available, the function will attempt to record a short sample
from the specified device.  Any errors during recording are silently ignored.
Regardless of whether actual recording succeeds, the function returns a simple
status string describing the target device.  This keeps the unit tests
predictable while providing a useful starting point for real recording logic.
